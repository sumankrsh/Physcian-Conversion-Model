# Physcian-Conversion-Model
An HCP conversion model aims to predict the likelihood of a healthcare provider (HCP) becoming a writer for a particular company or brand for the first time. It helps pharmaceutical or medical device companies identify potential HCPs who have not yet written prescriptions for their products but may be receptive to doing so in the future.
